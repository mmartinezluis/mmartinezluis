# Hi :smile:, I'm Luis

I enjoy learning new things and taking on challenges as they allow me to discover new ways of solving problems.

I'm currnelty working on Amazon API Gateway and Amazon DynamoDB to integrate a Followers/Following/Feed/Reactions feature to my StoQuotes open-source platform, written with Ruby on Rails on the backend, and JavaScript on the frontend.
