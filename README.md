# Hi :smile:, I'm Luis

I enjoy learning new things and taking on challenges as they allow me to discover new ways of solving problems. Here is some more info about me:
* I'm currenlty working on my :rocket:React and Redux final project at the Flatiron School. 
* :roller_coaster: I'm currenlty improving the codebase of or adding new features to my projects (feel free to contribute!)
* :seedling: Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering.
