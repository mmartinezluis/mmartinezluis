# Hi :smile:, I'm Luis

I enjoy learning new things and taking on challenges as they allow me to discover new ways of solving problems. Here is some more info about me:
* I'm currenlty working on DevBlog, my :rocket:React and Redux final project for the Flatiron School. [Clcik here to access DevBlog website](https://luisdevblog.netlify.app/). 
* Learning a ton from DevBlog --> all sorts of react hooks, custom hooks, using and managing state for a post editor, adding and displaying validations for react forms, implementing protected routes, extracting the data from asynchrnous functions, integrating Amazon Web Services (AWS), implementing JSON Web Tokens for user authentication/authorication, ....
* When becoming a developer, may people write, "Former ..."; I write, "Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering".
