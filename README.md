Hi, my name is Luis Martinez. I enjoy learning new things and taking on challenges as they allow me to discover new ways of solving problems. Here is some more info about me:
* I'm currenlty working on React as part of the final module at the Flatiron School. 
* I'm currenlty improving the codebase of or adding new features to my projects (feel free to contribute!)
