# Hi :smile:, I'm Luis

I enjoy learning new things and taking on challenges as they allow me to discover new ways of solving problems. Here is some more info about me:
* I recently finished the codesandboxes for a mini version of [DevBlog](https://devblog.dev/) that use the minimum amount of code to achieve data persistence for blog posts. You take a look at them [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/blog-website-prototype-p4lwp?file=/src/index.js) and [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/draft-js-wysiwygstable-53qnq); I wrote two supporting articles that explain how the code works in the codesandboxes [here](https://devblog.dev/posts/155) and [here](https://devblog.dev/posts/136), respectively.
* I'm currently studying Data Structures & Algorithms. I'm growing a repo with solved problems. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/mmartinezluis/algorithms-and-data-structures).
* I'm currenlty working on DevBlog, a React JS, Redux, and Ruby on Rails blog website. [Clcik here to access DevBlog](https://luisdevblog.netlify.app/). 
* Learning a ton from DevBlog --> sending emails to users upon registration, all sorts of react hooks, custom hooks, using, managing state and customizing a text editor (Draft JS), adding and displaying validations for react forms, implementing protected routes, extracting the data from asynchronous functions, integrating Amazon Web Services (AWS), implementing JSON Web Tokens (JWT), uploading and managing images, working with iframes, designing my own logo out of custom React components, designing users' profile pages, ....
* When becoming a developer, many people write, "Former ..."; I write, "Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering!".
