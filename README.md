# Hi :smile:, I'm Luis

I enjoy learning new things and taking on challenges as they allow me to discover new ways of solving problems. Here is some more info about me:

* I recently finished integrating email verification and password reset into [DevBlog](https://devblog.dev/). I wanted to write the least amount of code, so I came up with some clever solutions: handled email verification with just 2 routes in the frontend, and handled password reset with a master component that renders 4 different components (including two forms) with just 2 routes (take a look at [devblog-frontend/src/components/users/EmcailConfirmation.js](https://github.com/mmartinezluis/devblog-frontend/blob/main/src/components/users/EmailConfirmation.js) and [devblog-frontend/src/components/users/PasswordReset.js](https://github.com/mmartinezluis/devblog-frontend/blob/main/src/components/users/PasswordReset.js), respectively).
Would like more context? Take a look at this [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/luis-martinez-mosquete_react-reactjs-activity-6876022782979928064-EdfE)

* I finished the codesandboxes for a mini version of [DevBlog](https://devblog.dev/) that use the minimum amount of code to achieve data persistence for blog posts. You can take a look at them [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/blog-website-prototype-p4lwp?file=/src/index.js) and [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/draft-js-wysiwygstable-53qnq); I wrote two supporting articles that explain how the code works in the codesandboxes [here](https://devblog.dev/posts/155) and [here](https://devblog.dev/posts/136), respectively. What's cool about the codesanboxes? They run as an app in production, and all of your changes are saved (persisted) in real time!!!

* When becoming a developer, many people write, "Former ..."; I write, "Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering!".
